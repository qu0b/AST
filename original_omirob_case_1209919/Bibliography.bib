	Abstract = {The representation and processing of semantic information can today be accomplished using a wide range of formalisms. Rule-based approaches are not only a well-known but also easy to use technique. Most approaches rely on a textual specification of rules that can be processed by an according rule engine. For simplifying the specification and understanding of rules by domain experts, we present a visual model editor for rules based on the W3C SWRL recommendation. The goal of this approach is to provide a means for a visual interaction with rule-based systems, while at the same time preserving full expressiveness. The visual language for SWRL rules has been implemented on the SeMFIS platform. In addition, serialization and de-serialization mechanisms have been added for OWLXML and SWRLXML formats. As there are currently no official conformance tests available for SWRL, the approach has been evaluated using W3C sample set for SWRL rules.},

@article{cs4903,
	Abstract = {One key driver of the Linked Data paradigm is the ability to lift data graphs from legacy systems by employing various adapters and RDFizers (e.g., D2RQ for relational databases, XLWrap for spreadsheets). Such approaches aim towards removing boundaries of enterprise data silos by opening them to cross-organizational linking within a ?Web of Data?. An insufficiently tapped source of machine-readable semantics is the underlying graph nature of diagrammatic conceptual models ? a kind of information that is richer compared to what is typically lifted from table schemata, especially when a domain-specific modeling language is employed. The paper advocates an approach to Linked Data enrichment based on a diagrammatic model RDFizer originally developed in the context of the ComVantage FP7 research project. A minimal but illustrative example is provided from which arguments will be generalized, leading to a proposed vision of ?conceptual model?-aware information systems.},

@article{cs3657,
	Abstract = {In this paper we analyse the conceptualisation of modelling methods. Thereby we understand, how the
components of a specific implementation platform support the design of modelling methods. For this
purpose we use the ADOxx meta modelling platform and investigate, how four selected functionalities
of enterprise information systems for supporting user interaction, process-based optimization, interfaces
to other systems, and complex analyses are realized. We discuss these four functionalities by reverting
to excerpts of the visual representation of modelling methods from the areas of requirements engineering,
business process management, e-learning, and enterprise architecture management. This permits us to
highlight the interdependencies between the modelling language, the modelling procedure, mechanisms and
algorithms and the functionalities of the underlying technical platform that have to be taken into account
during the conceptualisation.},

@inproceedings{cs3473,
	Abstract = {Several approaches have been discussed in the past to manage
semantic aspects of semi-formal conceptual models based on mappings
of their elements to ontologies. In the paper at hand we describe the
foundations for these approaches, derive requirements for an according
tool support and present the design and implementation of the SeMFIS
toolkit together with use cases where it has been successfully applied.
In contrast to other approaches, SeMFIS is based on a meta modeling
approach that can be easily adapted and extended to support arbitrary
conceptual modeling languages. In addition it will be made freely available
for the scienti?c community in the context of the Open Models
Initiative.},
